    "\n",
    "What we want to know here is the Average Treatment Effect (ATE): \n",

    "$$\\mathbb{E}[Y_i \\mid D = i] \\neq \\mathbb{E}[Y_i]$$\n",

    "Meaning, that in reality, we can't observe both Y_{1} and Y_{0} for the same person (the \"fundamental problem of causal inference\"). Instead, we only see. Naively computing the raw difference in means is not not the ATE because of selection bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "*General problem:* \n",
    "\n",
    "If we believe that age, education, race, and marital status all have likely influence on earnings Y, we need a way to disentangle the effect of D on Y from the perturbative effect of X on Y. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Assumptions:* \n",
    "\n",
    "The CausalInference package is based on a typical assumption called unconfoundness (no confounder that messes up the relationship between cause and effect) or ignorability: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$(Y(0), Y(1)) \\perp D \\mid X$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Y(1) and Y(0) are independent of D given covariate X. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed we saw that the treatment assignment is probably not independent of each subject's potential outcomes, e.g. poorer people are more represented in the treatment group than in the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "However the treatment is assumed to be unconfounded in the sense that the dependence between the treatment assignment and the outcomes is only through something we observe, namely the covariates X.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that if we control for X, i.e. look across people with similar levels of X, then the difference between treated and control should be attributable to the treatment itself, just as a randomized experiment would be.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the assumption, and if it doesn't hold our results could be completely wrong.\n",
    "\n",

    "This model predicts that the Average Treatment Effect (ATE, the job training) is $1548 extra annual earnings. This is very different from our previous raw results predicting that the job training had negative effects on earnings!\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that our model accurately describes the counterfactual X, CausalModel provides the 95% confidence interval. What this means is that, if we were to repeat this treatment experiment, in 95% of the cases the Average Treatment Effect would be within that interval. That doesn't mean that the true value is within that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the assumption that the residuals are normally distributed, the 95% confidence interval is calculated as:\n",

    "In practice, as the confidence interval is very large, my interpretation is that the experiment should have had more people if a better estimate of the extra earnings was desired. Ways to control the standard deviation could also be explored.\n",

    "Overall, assuming that we controlled for all the effects and did it well, it seems that the job training had a positive effect on earnings. Indeed, although the standard deviation is very large, the p value of 0.035 rejects the null hypothesis (no effect) with a confidence level of 97.5%. However, the truth is that we don't know if we modelled the counterfactual well, and this could change everything... As we will see later, estimators such as the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimator can behave poorly when there is not enough covariate overlap, and that's because the estimator needs to extrapolate too much from one group to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more structured approach as we will see below can allow us to increase our confidence that the covariants are well controlled for. We will see many steps, but one simple idea is the technique of matching: the idea is to find for each sample which received the treatment a similar sample in the control group, and to directly compare these values.\n",

    "Blocking is a method used to reduce variation and improve the precision of an estimator by grouping units into blocks (or strata) based on similar characteristics or covariates. Within each block, treatment and control units are compared. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matching is a technique where treated units are \"paired\" with control units that have similar covariate values. The goal is to create a pseudo-experimental setup where treated and control groups look as similar as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-processing phase \n",
    "\n",
    "In the pre-processing phase, the data is inspected and manipulated to allow credible analysis to be conducted on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in the previous section, one key method for disantangling the treatment effect from the covariant effects is the matching technique. In this technique we compare subjects that have similar covariate values (i.e. same age, rage, income etc). However, our ability to compare such pairs depends heavily on the degree of overlap of the covariates between the treatment and control group. This is called covariate balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Said otherwise, to control the effect of education, one way is to look at people in the tested group and in the non-tested group that all have the same level of education, say a bachelor degree. However, if nobody in the test group has a bachelor degree while many do in the non-test group, this procedure is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) assess covariate balance to assess whether how easily people can be matched. If there is too much unbalance, direct matching will rarely be possible, and we may need to use more complex techniques, if at all possible."
